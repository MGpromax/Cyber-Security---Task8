# VPN Setup Report — Task 8

Instructions
- Replace placeholders with your real results. Add redacted screenshots under `screenshots/`.

Overview
- Date/time: [YYYY‑MM‑DD HH:MM]
- Platform/OS: [Windows/macOS/Linux/iOS/Android]
- Network context: [Home/Office/Public Wi‑Fi]
- Provider/tier: [ProtonVPN Free / Windscribe Free]
- App version: [e.g., 3.2.0]
- Privacy policy link: [URL]

Connection Details
- Server location: [Country/City]
- Protocol: [WireGuard / OpenVPN / IKEv2]
- Kill switch: [On/Off]
- Auto‑connect: [On/Off]
- Split tunneling: [Off / list of apps excluded]
- IPv6 handling: [Tunneled/Disabled/Not available]

Verification
- IP before: [IP, Geo]
- IP after VPN: [IP, Geo]
- DNS leak test: [No leaks / Provider DNS / Notes]
- IPv6 leak test: [No leaks / Leaks observed / Not applicable]
- WebRTC leak test: [No leaks / Local/Remote IP exposed / Not tested]

Performance (fast.com or Speedtest)
- Baseline (no VPN): Run 3 tests → [Down avg / Up avg / Latency avg] (individual: [d1/u1/p1], [d2/u2/p2], [d3/u3/p3])
- With VPN: Run 3 tests → [Down avg / Up avg / Latency avg] (individual: [d1/u1/p1], [d2/u2/p2], [d3/u3/p3])
- Protocol comparison (optional): [WG avg vs OVPN avg]
- Notes: [e.g., latency +20 ms, throughput −25%, occasional captchas]

Screenshots
- VPN connected status: `screenshots/vpn-connected.png`
- IP verification: `screenshots/ip-check.png`
- DNS leak test result: `screenshots/dns-leak.png`
- (Optional) IPv6 leak / WebRTC: `screenshots/ipv6-webrtc.png`

Benefits Observed
- [e.g., IP masked from ISP/local network, protection on public Wi‑Fi]

Limitations Observed
- [e.g., slower speed, certain sites blocked, additional captchas]

Summary
- Short paragraph summarizing what you set up, how you verified it worked, and your understanding of VPN privacy/limitations.
